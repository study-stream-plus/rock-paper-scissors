# Rock, Paper, Scissors in Python

## About
- This is the full code for the Python exercise: "Rock, Paper, Scissors Game"
- [Watch the free video tutorial on the StudyStream+ YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmgE0DaNXKw)

## Exercise
Using Python, write a script which allows a human to play a game of rock, paper scissors with a computer unlimited times.
We want the player, to be able to play again without manually having to restart the game and to stop the game so he/she can continue with her work!
